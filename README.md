# Concurrent Port Scanners
---

## Overview
This repository contains the source code for some **Concurrent Port Scanners** written in different programming languages in the standalone source files.

- [Scala](https://github.com/rezzzza/multithreaded-port-scanners/tree/master/scala)
- Java
- [Python](https://github.com/rezzzza/multithreaded-port-scanners/tree/master/python)
- Ruby
- Go

_More languages will be supported: [List of concurrent and parallel programming languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_concurrent_and_parallel_programming_languages)_

## Introduction
We'll use the source codes to provide a method that:

- Compare the implementation of the [Concurrency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_(computer_science)) in the different languages.
- Compare the different methods and models of concurrency and parallelism for each programming language.


## Using guide
There is a README in the section of each programming language.
